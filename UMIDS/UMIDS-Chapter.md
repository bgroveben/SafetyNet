# SafetyNet Unique Machine Identification System (UMIDS) Mini-Manual

This mini-manual is intended to be a light-hearted explanation for people with 
limited technical knowledge, or for people who are bored silly by reading about 
hardware specifications, networking protocols, and software compatibility. The 
features and user interfaces are simplified versions of the real thing.

## Introduction

SafetyNet Unique Machine Identification System (UMIDS) serves as a crucial tool for the precise categorization and identification of Autonomous Intelligent Aerial Vehicles (AIAVs) within the IDNGLO network. This mini-manual provides an overview of UMIDS, detailing its primary and additional attributes, identification and retrieval methods, integration with existing systems, unique machine identification (UMID) generation, security measures, and information storage processes. UMIDS is like the nightclub bouncer of SafetyNet. No ID? Invalid ID? Not on the guest list? They won't get past UMIDS security.

### Purpose and Scope

- UMIDS facilitates efficient classification and identification of AIAVs.
- Leverages primary and additional attributes for comprehensive AIAV management.
- Enhances real-time tracking, situational awareness, and decision-making within the IDNGLO network.
- Facilitates secure communications between components as well as between AIAVs for cooperative activities like drone swarms.
- Facilitates secure communications between Human-Machine and external network interfaces.
