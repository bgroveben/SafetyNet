# Experiment/Demonstration: SafetyNet Communication Proof of Concept

Conducting tests and experiments using software simulations can be highly beneficial  during the development and prototyping stages. Here are some advantages:

1. **Cost-Effective Testing:** Simulations allow you to test various scenarios without the cost associated with deploying physical drones. This is especially useful in the early stages of system development and testing.

2. **Scenario Replication:** Simulations enable you to replicate specific scenarios and conditions, helping you understand how different drones perform in various environments, weather conditions, or mission types.

3. **Rapid Prototyping:** You can quickly iterate and test different configurations, mission plans, or drone types in a simulated environment, accelerating the prototyping phase.

4. **Risk-Free Exploration:** Simulations provide a risk-free environment to explore the capabilities of different drones. This is particularly important for complex or high-risk missions where real-world testing may be impractical.

5. **Data Collection and Analysis:** Simulations allow for detailed data collection and analysis, helping you evaluate drone performance, communication protocols, and system behavior under different circumstances.

6. **Interoperability Testing:** Simulations enable thorough testing of interoperability between different drone models and the central control system, ensuring seamless integration.

7. **Training and Skill Development:** Simulations are valuable for training operators and testing their skills in managing the drone network. This can help identify areas for improvement in operation procedures.

8. **Scale Testing:** Simulations make it easier to conduct large-scale testing, involving a significant number of drones, which may be logistically challenging in the real world.

9. **Scenario Planning:** Simulated scenarios can help in strategic planning by assessing how drones perform in different mission types, allowing you to tailor your drone fleet for specific roles effectively.

However, it's important to note that simulations have limitations, and real-world testing is crucial for validating the performance of drones in actual operational conditions. Combining both simulation and physical testing can provide a robust approach to selecting the best drones for each job, ensuring that your system meets the desired performance criteria in real-world scenarios.

## Materials Needed:

1. **Simulated Drones:** Utilize drone simulation software or physical drones equipped with communication modules.
2. **Communication Protocols:** Develop or simulate communication protocols that mimic the SafetyNet standards.
3. **Control Center:** A centralized control center to monitor and manage the drone network. My laptop will do for now.

## Experimental Steps:

### 1. Global Scope Communication:
   - Simulate multiple drones designated as Global Scope Drones (GS).
   - Demonstrate that all GS drones can communicate with each other regardless of their location on a global scale.

### 2. Local Scope Communication:
   - Simulate drones designated as Local Scope Drones (LD) within a specific area.
   - Organize LDs into groups, and demonstrate communication within each group.
   - Emphasize that LDs in different groups cannot directly communicate.

### 3. Global Sentry (GS) to Local Boss (LB) Communication:
   - Designate one GS drone and several LDs as Local Bosses (LBs) within a specific area.

### 4. Restricted Communication to Global Sentry:
   - Show that only LDs designated as LBs can communicate with the GS drone.
   - Demonstrate that regular LDs cannot establish direct communication with the GS drone.

### 5. Local Boss (LB) Communication:
   - Showcase communication between all LBs within a specified area.
   - Emphasize that LBs can communicate with each other, fostering coordination within their designated area.

### 6. Variable Area Sizes:
   - Vary the size of the designated areas to showcase scalability.
   - Demonstrate that the communication principles hold true for areas of different sizes.
   - Introduce multiple GS and LB drones to demonstrate flexibility in deployment.

## Key Metrics to Measure:

- **Communication Latency:** Measure the time taken for messages to travel between drones.
- **Scalability:** Evaluate how well the system scales with an increasing number of drones and changing area sizes.
- **Reliability:** Ensure that communication remains reliable even in challenging scenarios or high network congestion.

### Data Collection:
- Record communication logs, including timestamps, message content, and sender/receiver details.
- Document any instances of successful or unsuccessful communication.

### Analysis:
- Analyze the collected data to verify that the system meets the desired communication objectives.
- Identify any bottlenecks or limitations in the system.

### Conclusion:
- Summarize the findings and provide a conclusion regarding the effectiveness of the SafetyNet communication system.
- Highlight the system's adaptability to various scenarios and its ability to manage communication across different scopes.
