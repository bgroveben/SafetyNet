## SafetyNet Airborne AIAVs

This section outlines a phased approach for safely and efficiently integrating SafetyNet's airborne AIAVs (any autonomous aerial system, vehicle, or drone) into the existing United States airspace. It's important to address technical challenges, regulatory limitations, and public concerns to ensure a smooth and responsible transition.

### **Phase 1: Foundation Building (1-2 years)**

-   **Technology Maturity:** Focus on refining AIAV capabilities through extensive testing and development. This includes:
    -   **Enhanced sensing and perception:** Advancements in LiDAR, radar, and environmental sensors for superior situational awareness.
    -   **Robust communication:** Development of reliable, low-latency communication protocols for seamless data exchange with IDNGLO and ground control.
    -   **Improved collision avoidance:** Refinement of AI algorithms for autonomous navigation and dynamic obstacle avoidance.
    -   **Cybersecurity enhancements:** Implementation of robust security measures to protect against cyberattacks and ensure data integrity.
-   **Regulatory Framework:** Collaborate with the FAA and other stakeholders to establish clear regulations and standards for AIAV operations. This includes:
    -   **Defining operational parameters:** Setting airspace restrictions, altitude limits, and safety protocols for different types of missions and environments.
    -   **Standardization of communication protocols:** Ensuring compatibility between AIAVs and existing air traffic management systems.
    -   **Certification and licensing:** Develop procedures for AIAV airworthiness certification and operator licensing.
