# Our Autonomous Present and Future

## How SafetyNet can help make the world better:

SafetyNet is a network of artificially intelligent autonomous systems that can be built using existing tools and technologies. The purpose of SafetyNet is to integrate existing, planned, and future autonomous systems and vehicles into a nationwide network that can help people all over the United States of America. This nationwide network can then be expanded to become a Global Network of Autonomous Systems that will revolutionize infrastructure, industry, transportation, communication, space exploration, scientific research, and the world as we know it.
