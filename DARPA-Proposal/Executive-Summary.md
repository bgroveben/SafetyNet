## Executive Summary for DARPA

**A. Topic Area:** Defense Sciences (DSO) - Transformative Autonomy and Decision Making (TADM)

**B. Title:** **Low-Cost Autonomous Flight Control System for Fixed-Wing UAVs**

**C. Summary of Effort:** This project proposes the development and demonstration of a low-cost, high-performance autonomous flight control system for fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). By repurposing existing servo controllers and integrating them with open-source software/firmware, we aim to provide a cost-effective and accessible solution for autonomous flight, particularly for educational and research purposes within the defense community.

**D. Introduction/Background:**

-   Traditional autonomous flight control systems are often expensive and complex, limiting their accessibility and hindering broader adoption for research and training.
-   Open-source flight control software like Ardupilot and PX4 offer promising alternatives, but require specific hardware configurations not readily available in budget-constrained settings.
-   This project addresses this gap by leveraging existing servo controllers, a common and affordable component in hobbyist UAVs.

**E. Impact:**

-   **Increased accessibility:** This project will democratize autonomous flight technology by offering a low-cost and readily available solution for educational institutions and research groups within the DoD.
-   **Faster innovation:** Broader access to autonomous UAV platforms will accelerate research and development in areas like aerial reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition.
-   **Enhanced training:** Cost-effective autonomous UAVs can be used for realistic training scenarios, improving pilot skills and readiness for real-world operations.

**F. Methods/Approach:**

-   **Phase 1: Repurposing Servo Controllers:**
    -   Integrate existing servo controllers with open-source flight control software through custom communication protocols.
    -   Develop flight control algorithms specifically tailored for the repurposed hardware.
-   **Phase 2: System Integration and Testing:**
    -   Integrate the converted flight controller with a low-cost flight computer and existing open-source software/firmware.
    -   Conduct extensive testing in simulated environments and on a prototype UAV platform.
    -   Refine algorithms and troubleshoot any integration issues.
-   **Phase 3: Flight Demonstration and Dissemination:**
    -   Conduct initial flight tests with the autonomous UAV, gradually increasing complexity and risk.
    -   Analyze flight data and refine algorithms for optimal performance.
    -   Prepare comprehensive documentation and user guides for wider dissemination within the DoD community.

**Timeline:**

-   Project duration: 60 days (starting from Phase 2)
-   Key milestones:
    -   Flight control software development (Day 11)
    -   Test bench setup and simulation (Day 31)
    -   Prototype conversion and testing (Day 36)
    -   Initial flight tests and refinement (Day 56)

**Conclusion:** This project offers a cost-effective and accessible solution for autonomous flight control in fixed-wing UAVs. By leveraging existing technologies and open-source software, it has the potential to revolutionize training, research, and innovation within the DoD community. We believe this project aligns perfectly with DARPA's mission to "prevent and create technological surprise" and request your support in making it a reality.
