    -   **Consulting and implementation:** Offer consulting services to help organizations integrate NSI into their existing systems.
-   **IDNGLO:**
    -   **Subscription-based communication network:** Charge for secure, high-bandwidth communication channels within the network.
    -   **Data analytics services:** Offer insights and analysis of data collected through the network for strategic decision-making.

**Hardware Monetization:**

-   **AIAVs:**
    -   **Direct sales:** Sell individual AIAVs or packages to military forces.
    -   **Leasing:** Offer leasing options for AIAVs, particularly for shorter-term deployments or training purposes.
    -   **Maintenance and repair services:** Provide ongoing maintenance and repair services for deployed AIAVs.
-   **DCMS:**
    -   **Software licensing:** License the DCMS software to other organizations managing large fleets of autonomous vehicles.
    -   **Consulting and implementation:** Offer consulting services to help organizations implement and integrate the DCMS.

**Intellectual Property (IP) Monetization:**

-   **Patents:** File patents for key technologies like NSI, IDNGLO, and AIAVs to generate royalty income through licensing or potential future sales.
-   **Copyrights:** Copyright software code and algorithms to protect intellectual property and prevent unauthorized use.
-   **Trademarks:** Register trademarks for Project SafetyNet branding and logos to establish brand recognition and value.

**Other Revenue Streams:**
