**Government regulations:**  Evolving regulations on AI, autonomous vehicles, and data privacy may require significant adaptations and delay deployment.

**International compliance:**  Varying regulations across countries could complicate global deployment and require specific adaptations for each region.

**Public acceptance:**  Concerns about safety, privacy, and ethical implications of AI-powered autonomous systems could hinder public adoption and regulatory approvals.

### d) Other Factors:

**Supply Chain Disruptions:**
   - Risk: Disruptions in the supply chain affecting manufacturing and deployment.
   - Mitigation: Diversify suppliers, maintain strategic reserves, and contingency plans for supply chain disruptions.

**Natural Disasters and External Threats:**
   - Risk: Natural disasters or external threats impacting the operational capabilities of SafetyNet.
   - Mitigation: Develop contingency plans, redundancy in critical systems, and regular disaster recovery drills.

**Project management challenges:**  Complexities in managing a large-scale project with diverse stakeholders could lead to delays, cost overruns, and communication breakdowns.

**Accidents and liability issues:**  Potential accidents involving AIAVs could lead to public backlash, legal liability, and reputational damage.

**Unforeseen events:**  Political instability or economic disruptions could impact project timelines and resource availability.

## 3. Risk Mitigation
