Leading UAV developers DraganFly, Quantum-Systems, AeroVironment, and Teledyne Flir are among the companies that have provided cutting-edge aerial craft to Ukraine’s defense against the Russian invasion, but Australian firm SYPAQ Systems is distinguishing itself in that supportive effort by providing Kyiv with drones made of cardboard.

Melbourne-based SYPAQ announced its move to supply an undisclosed number of its Corvo drones to Ukraine as part of Australia’s backing of Kyiv’s defense against Russian attacking forces. Developed as what the company calls a Precision Payload Delivery System (PPDS), Corvo UAVs are almost entirely constructed of cardboard. They are delivered several at a time in flatpacks, and quickly assembled using basic materials like tape, glue, and – going by a SYPAQ photo accompanying its announcement – either thick string or rubber bands holding the wings and body together.

Indeed, the techiest tool required to put the craft together is reportedly a monkey wrench to mount the front-end motor and propeller. Be that as it may, that simplified version of an IKEA bookshelf slap-together process contrasts with the craft’s geek bona fides when in operation.

SYPAQ says the cardboard drone will allow Ukraine’s pilots to fly it on missions of up to 120 kilometers, using easily pre-programmed routes for automated operation that frees up would-be pilots for other tasks until the UAV returns. Onboard tech also permits the craft to figure out where it is and continue its assigned trajectory in GPS-denied areas, or amid serious Russian communication jamming.

Corvo, SYPAQ notes, will offer Ukraine forces a “low cost, expendable drone for the delivery of supplies and equipment into areas traditional logistics capabilities cannot reach.” But it adds that working on feedback provided by Ukrainian operators, the UAV “has also been adapted for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions” using various kinds of specialized sensor payloads.

Those added capacities logically suggest SYPAQ’s pizza box drones can gather actionable information on Russian positions and preparations up to 60 kilometers away, then return with precise detail for Ukraine troops to use in preventive or pro-active operations. 

Officials in Ukraine have acknowledged the drone can also be modified to drop munitions – and have already been used that way against enemy targets.

Should the UAVs be spotted and neutralized, all that’s lost is the couple or three thousand bucks they reportedly cost (the company does not communicate its prices), as well as onboard sensors – far less expensive than the destruction of adapted enterprise, public safety, or military-grade craft normally deployed.

The Corvo support comes as part of Australia’s assistance to Kyiv in battling Russia’s invasion, with the craft having been developed under a AUS $11 million ($7.3 million) contract with the government’s Defence Innovation Hub. 

Despite the low-tech nature of the drone’s main component, SYPAQ CEO Amanda Holt says the Corvo system will provide Ukraine with an affordable but highly effective aerial asset – and one the company is delivering at the rate of about 100 per month.

“PPDS is an Australian capability that will help the Ukrainian people defend their country, and is proof of the world-leading autonomous systems capabilities in Australian industry,” Holt said. “This capability is the result of an innovation journey with the Army and the Defence Innovation Hub, and demonstrates the importance of collaboration between Defence and industry on capability development.”

The Corvo PPDS is an expendable drone intended to deliver supplies and equipment into areas traditional logistics capabilities cannot reach. Following feedback from the Ukrainian military, the system has also been adapted for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions.

The drones come in a flat-pack kit, each slightly longer than a takeaway pizza box – the pallet shown below holds 24 of these kits including their assembly materials, tools, motors and batteries. Led by the pragmatically-conscious designers at SYPAQ, we followed their demonstration as well as the user guides to make the drone that Army and Defence Innovation Hub envision will be a 3kg-payload carrying drone which has a secondary mission profile to be an airborne, loitering re-transmitter. 

Lance Corporal Will Coyer, a distribution soldier at 7th Combat Service Support Battalion said, “Corvo PPDS was easy to put together – certain parts required attention to detail, but the precision manufacturing of the flat-pack kit made it simple.” One of the objectives of seeing soldiers assemble the UAS was to identify the ease with which any soldier can put this drone together with only simple tools: a glue gun, knife, pen and tape. A spanner is only required for the final assembly of a propeller, and most of the magic in this UAS lies in the software which includes an autopilot, in-flight planning to waypoints and loiter areas, and managing only two control surfaces: the Corvo PPDS has an elevon on each side, and no rudder.

That flight magic is physically held in a piece of computing that is barely larger than a piece of toast, and it’s easily plugged into the motor and elevon controls. SYPAQ spent most of its development in the software itself, noting that the hardware (model airplanes) aren’t particularly new, and sought to keep costs down whilst offering more sophistication. In fact, the software, including a simulation interface, is so good that any soldier is able to launch a sortie within minutes of developing a plan on the standard Android tablet, using their fingers to drop waypoint and loiter orbits, and designate a landing point. The software even estimates the flight time, total distance to fly, and ensures the mission can be flown within connectivity once launched – a key feature for the GPS-denied battlespace.

The Corvo Precision Payload Delivery System (PPDS) costs less than $3,500 apiece, a price made possible by the craft's use of FOSS and commercial-off-the-shelf hardware.

Michael Partridge, SYPAQ's general manager for Innovation & Strategic Programs (I&SP), told The Register ArduPilot autopilot software, unspecified hardware that SYPAQ customizes, and waxed cardboard. The drone takes around an hour to assemble, we're told, and its lithium-ion batteries give it a range of up to 100km (62 miles) with a 3kg (6.6lb) payload.

The craft ships in a flat pack complete with tape, glue, and instructions on how to assemble it. A tablet computer is also included so users can tell Corvo where to fly by entering GPS coordinates. A wired connection to upload that flight plan is required, but once Corvo is aloft, it will proceed along its route, at a specified altitude, and land itself at its determined destination.

SYPAQ will happily ship a single Corvo, but also offers a "capability pack" that includes multiple craft, spares, and the slingshot-powered launch ramp the craft needs to get airborne.

Partridge said single Corvo units have survived more than 20 flights and that the waxed cardboard wing can handle moisture well, without losing its aerodynamic qualities.

Users in the Ukrainian armed forces have adapted the craft to different roles too. Partridge said adding a camera requires some light hacking – of the drone's cardboard airframe.

"It has a cargo bay [and] you can do whatever you want in there within the 3kg payload. You can cut a hole through the aircraft to look through it and insert a camera."

For now, SYPAQ hasn't given Corvo's onboard computer wireless capabilities, partly to reduce cost and partly to ensure stealth. But Partridge said Corvos have carried action cameras like the GoPro and users are happy to retrieve removable media once the plane lands. SYPAQ is working on payloads that allow wireless transmission of images, possibly over long distances.

He told The Register that Australia's military, and others around the world, are keen on Corvo as it represents a just-in-time drone capability that gives them an eye in the sky or the ability to deliver payloads when surface transport becomes unfeasible. Emergency services are another target market: he mentioned the ability to reconnoitre a recently flooded region or observing the progress of a fire as ideal applications.

Using off-the-shelf electronics makes Corvo resilient because damaged parts can easily be replaced or borrowed from another unit. It also means SYPAQ can innovate quickly because it has less development work to do when creating new models.

The cardboard airframe is also easy to work with, both in development and in the field. Users in Ukraine have patched up their Corvos with cardboard they had to hand.

Partridge believes Corvo's combination of "low cost and significant endurance" means drones will find new roles in the military and beyond, and show that the craft don't have to be expensive or require technical skills.

Developed in Melbourne in partnership with the Australian Army and under a $1.1 million Defence Innovation Hub contract, the Corvo PPDS is a low-cost, expendable drone for the delivery of supplies and equipment into areas traditional logistics capabilities cannot reach. Also known as the ‘cardboard plane’, the PPDS is controlled by a military-grade guidance system that requires no user input once the aircraft is launched. PPDS drones can carry payloads of 3 kilograms (7 pounds) and 5 kilograms (11 pounds), depending on the model; they can fly out to 120 kilometers (75 miles). Though not built from durable metal or plastic, some PPDS drones have managed to make 60 flights in Ukraine. The cardboard is wax-coated to enable flights in wet weather.

Also known as the ‘cardboard drone’, the supply of the PPDS capability to Ukraine was first revealed during the Avalon Air Show in early March, with the drones being delivered as flat-packed “capability bricks” of 100 aircraft each month. The PPDS is launched by a catapult, can fly up to 120km and land by itself, delivering supplies or providing a low-cost surveillance capability. Needless to say how 'stealthy' such a cardboard drone is, making it (very) difficult for air defense systems to detect, track and either jam or shoot down. Following feedback from end-users in Ukraine, the system has been adapted for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions.
