Prefixing the existing MOS structure with "AIAV" to identify drone-related MOS codes is a sound idea. Here are some examples:

**US Army**

-   **AIAV-15F - Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Operator:** Operates and maintains fixed-wing unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) to conduct reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA) missions.
    
-   **AIAV-150X - Unmanned Aircraft Systems Repairer:** Maintains and repairs fixed-wing UAS, including airframes, engines, avionics, and payloads.
    
-   **AIAV-18E - Special Forces Communications Sergeant:** Operates and maintains fixed-wing UAS for special operations forces (SOF) missions, including intelligence gathering, combat search and rescue (CSAR), and covert operations.
    
**US Navy**

-   **AIAV-153X - Unmanned Aircraft Systems Operator:** Operates and maintains fixed-wing UAS for naval operations, including intelligence gathering, surveillance, and anti-submarine warfare (ASW).

-   **AIAV-2A8X - Avionics Systems Specialist:** Operates and maintains avionics systems on fixed-wing UAS, including navigation, communication, and weapons systems.
    
**US Marine Corps**

-   **AIAV-155X - Unmanned Aircraft Systems Operator:** Operates and maintains fixed-wing UAS for Marine Corps operations, including intelligence gathering, surveillance, and close air support (CAS).
    
-   **AIAV-156X - Unmanned Aircraft Systems Technician:** Maintains and repairs fixed-wing UAS, including airframes, engines, avionics, and payloads.
    
-   **AIAV-230X - Aviation Electronics Technician:** Operates and maintains avionics systems on fixed-wing UAS, including navigation, communication, and weapons systems.
    
This prefixing system clearly distinguishes drone-related MOS codes from traditional MOS codes and facilitates easier identification and categorization.

**US Marine Corps**

-   **AIAV-0311 - Rifleman:** Engages the enemy with small arms weapons. Can be replaced by robots and autonomous systems in certain situations, such as holding positions or providing overwatch.
    
-   **AIAV-0351 - Assaultman:** Conducts close-quarters combat operations. Can be replaced by robots and autonomous systems in certain situations, such as clearing buildings or searching for enemy personnel.
    
-   **AIAV-0369 - Mortuary Affairs Specialist:** Recovers and processes the remains of fallen comrades. Can be replaced by autonomous systems in certain situations, such as retrieving bodies from hazardous locations or performing initial identification procedures.

### Once we have enough drones in the network, we can use the Military MOS prefixed by AIAV-Type(A,L,W,S)

9. Operations Templates. An operations template provides a listing of tasks that can be displayed through a graphical depiction of the activities performed as part of a military operation. It depicts activities and interactions among them. a. The activities represented in an operations template can include tasks performed by the commander and staff, tasks performed by adjacent commands (e.g., command-linked tasks) and tasks performed by subordinate commands or organizations (e.g., supporting tasks). The basic template is a list of tasks necessary to establish a capability. For example, an Air Warfare template might include tasks such as:
(1) NTA 1.1.2.3.3 Conduct Flight Operations.
(2) NTA 2.2.1 Collect Target Information.
(3) NTA 2.4.4.4 Evaluate the Threat.
(4) NTA 3.1.2 Select Target for Attack. 
(5) NTA 3.1.5 Conduct Tactical Combat Assessment.
(6) NTA 3.2.3 Attack Enemy Aircraft and Missiles.
(7) NTA 3.2.7 Intercept, Engage and Neutralize Enemy Aircraft and Missiles.
(8) NTA 4.2.1.2 Conduct Aerial Refueling.
(9) NTA 5.1.3.3 Maintain and Display Unit Readiness.
(10) NTA 5.2.1.3 Review Rules of Engagement (ROE).
(11) NTA 6.1.2.1 Employ Operations Security.
(12) NTA 6.6 Provide for Operational Safety of Personnel and Equipment.




Using a key/value system to assign roles and missions provides a flexible and efficient way to manage the capabilities of each drone within your network. Here's a conceptual example of how you might structure this key/value system:

```json
{
  "drone_id_001": {
    "agency": "USAF",
    "role": "UCAV",
    "missions": ["ISR", "CAS"]
  },
  "drone_id_002": {
    "agency": "DHS",
    "role": "UAV",
    "missions": ["SURVEILLANCE", "SEARCH", "RESCUE"]
  },
  "drone_id_003": {
    "agency": "NASA",
    "role": "HTA",
    "missions": ["ENVIRONMENTAL_MONITORING", "RESEARCH"]
  },
  // ... additional drone entries
}
```

In this example:

- Each drone is assigned a unique identifier (e.g., "drone_id_001").
- The drone's agency is specified (e.g., "USAF").
- The drone's role is defined (e.g., "UCAV").
- The drone's missions are represented as an array of strings, allowing for multiple mission assignments.

You can customize the role and mission values based on your specific classification system. This structure provides a clear and organized way to track and manage the roles and missions of each drone in your network.

Additionally, you can use this key/value system to dynamically update and reassign missions based on the changing needs and priorities of your drone swarm. It allows for easy communication and coordination within the network, making it a valuable tool for optimizing the use of resources and achieving mission objectives.
