# SafetyNet: Technical Report for Architectural Decisions

This report provides a comprehensive technical analysis of the SafetyNet project, focusing on the selection of appropriate architectures for its individual components and the overall system. We examine key requirements, candidate architectures, specific component needs, and trade-offs to guide the decision-making process.

SafetyNet envisions a network of interconnected AI-powered Autonomous Vehicles (AIAVs) operating across Air, Land, Water, and Space (ALWS). This ambitious project comprises five core components:

-   **Artificially Intelligent Autonomous Vehicles (AIAVs):** Independent vehicles capable of self-navigation and mission execution.
-   **Drone Constellation Management System (DCMS):** Centralized platform for controlling and optimizing the AIAV fleet.
-   **Integrated Drone Network for Global and Local Operations (IDNGLO):** Global communication infrastructure for AIAVs.
-   **Neural Swarm Intelligence (NSI):** Collaborative intelligence framework for shared learning and decision-making among AIAVs.
-   **Unique Machine Identification System (UMIDS):** System for identifying and tracking AIAVs across diverse environments.
