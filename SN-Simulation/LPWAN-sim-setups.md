-   **Long-range coverage:** Provide wider coverage than traditional cellular networks, extending drone operations.
-   **Low data rates:** Optimized for small, infrequent data transmissions, aligning with SafetyNet's sensor data and control signals.

**Simulation Approaches:**

2.  **Network simulators:**
    
    -   Use tools like NS-3, OMNeT++, or Cooja (specifically for LoRaWAN) to model network behavior, including signal propagation, interference, and data transmission.
    -   Configure them to simulate LPWAN characteristics accurately.
    
4.  **Testbeds:**
    
    -   Set up physical LPWAN testbeds using hardware and software components to replicate real-world conditions.
