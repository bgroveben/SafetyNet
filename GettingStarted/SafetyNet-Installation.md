## II. Installation

To successfully deploy SafetyNet, follow these comprehensive installation and configuration steps:

### AIAV Setup:

1. **Install AIAV Firmware:**
   - Download the latest firmware version from the SafetyNet website or the AIAV manufacturer's website.
   - Follow the manufacturer's instructions to install the firmware on each AIAV.
   - Ensure compatibility with the SafetyNet Control Suite.

2. **Attach Sensors and Payloads:**
   - Mount any required sensors (cameras, radars, lidars) and payloads (delivery modules, medical supplies, etc.) securely to the AIAVs.
   - Configure sensor settings and payload functions according to mission requirements.
   - Verify proper connections and power supply.

3. **Establish Communication Links:**
   - Configure the AIAVs' communication modules to connect to the IDNGLO network.
   - Enter necessary network settings (SSID, password, encryption keys).
   - Test connectivity by sending and receiving test signals.

### Ground Control Station (GCS) Setup:

1. **Install SafetyNet Control Suite:**
   - Download the SafetyNet Control Suite software from the SafetyNet website.
   - Run the installation wizard, following the on-screen instructions.
   - Accept the software license agreement and choose installation options.
   - Verify successful installation.

2. **Connect to AIAVs:**
   - Use the SafetyNet Control Suite to establish a connection with the AIAVs.
   - Enter the AIAVs' unique identification codes or IP addresses.
   - Confirm successful connection and initiate communication.

### Network Configuration:

1. **Set Up IDNGLO:**
   - Install and configure the IDNGLO software on designated network devices.
   - Define network parameters (IP addresses, subnets, routing tables).
   - Establish secure communication channels using encryption protocols.
   - Test network connectivity and data transmission.

2. **Configure Firewall Rules:**
   - Adjust firewall settings to allow necessary communication ports and protocols for SafetyNet components.
   - Ensure access to DCMS servers and IDNGLO network while blocking unauthorized access.

### DCMS Configuration:

1. **Deploy DCMS Software:**
   - Install the DCMS software on designated servers.
   - Configure database connections and system settings.
   - Set up user accounts and access permissions.

2. **Register AIAVs:**
   - Use the DCMS interface to register each AIAV in the system.
   - Enter AIAV specifications, sensor capabilities, and payload configurations.
   - Assign unique identification codes and mission profiles.

### UMIDS Integration:

1. **Enable UMIDS:**
   - Activate the UMIDS functionality within the AIAV control systems and DCMS.
   - Ensure proper communication and data exchange between UMIDS components.
   - Verify accurate machine identification and tracking capabilities.

### Additional Configuration:

1. **Calibrate Sensors:**
   - Perform calibration procedures for sensors on AIAVs to ensure accurate data collection.
   - Follow manufacturer guidelines for specific sensor calibration methods.

2. **Set Up Encryption:**
   - Implement encryption measures for data transmission and storage to protect sensitive information.
   - Utilize recommended encryption standards and protocols.

3. **Test Functionality:**
   - Conduct thorough testing of all SafetyNet components to verify proper operation and communication.
   - Simulate mission scenarios to identify any potential issues or errors.
   - Address any problems discovered during testing.

By diligently following these steps, you'll ensure a successful deployment of SafetyNet, setting the stage for intelligent and seamless drone operations across various environments and missions.
